Been thinkin' 'bout gettin' me a new pair of boots. 
These ones are startin' to feel mighty worn out. 
I reckon it's about time, too. 
Been stompin' around in these old boots for longer than I can remember. 
They've seen more miles than a trailblazer's horse, that's for sure. 
But lately, I can feel 'em pinchin' and rubbin' in all the wrong places. 
Ain't nothin' worse than sore feet when you're tryin' to enjoy a night out at the saloon. 
Might swing by the cobbler's tomorrow and see what he's got in stock. 
Can't go wrong with a sturdy pair of leather boots, I always say. 
Gotta take care of your feet if you wanna keep on walkin' tall in this wild west of ours.
