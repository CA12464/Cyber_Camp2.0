Speaking of storms, reckon we should reinforce the roof of the saloon before winter sets in? Last year, that big ol' blizzard nearly tore half of it off, and I ain't in the mood for another round of repairs. 
The wind was howlin' like a banshee, and them snowflakes were thicker than a buffalo stampede. 
We were lucky the whole dang thing didn't come crashin' down on our heads. 
But I ain't takin' no chances this time around. 
Gonna need some sturdy hands and strong timber if we're gonna weather the winter without a hitch. 
I reckon we'll need to patch up them weak spots, tighten them loose shingles, and maybe even add a few extra supports. 
Wouldn't hurt to have an extra layer of insulation too. 
Lord knows we'll need it when them frosty winds come whistlin' through.
