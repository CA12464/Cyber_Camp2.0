Heard there's a new shipment of whiskey comin' in next week. 
Might have to stock up while I can. 
You know how scarce the good stuff gets 'round these parts once winter sets in. 
Folks start hoardin' like it's the end of days, and before you know it, there ain't a drop of bourbon to be found for miles. 
Can't say I blame 'em though. 
Ain't nothin' like a sip of whiskey to warm the bones on them cold winter nights. 
Reckon I'll head over to the general store first thing tomorrow and see if I can snag me a bottle or two before they're all gone. 
Can't afford to miss out on the good stuff, not when there's a long winter ahead.
